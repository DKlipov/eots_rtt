//MOVEMENT
1. On click to unit game propose you valid destination points, but if needed you could move them step-by-step
2. Offensive units by default try to avoid enemy zoi, to reduce enemy intercept ability, but check only ZOI that exists
at start of the move.
3. Supply and zoi checks after every movement step of every unit stack.
4. Game offer you to commit ranged-attack-able units to battle just after move, but you free skip it (if it is not a CV
in open sea). All ranged-attack-able could be assigned to the battle at "declare battle hex" step (if not assigned before).
5. By default game offer you move type that allows post-battle movement and be committed to battle. If you want use
"strategic redeploy" ability or move with extended range by short-range air use special button.
//REACTION
1. Game offer you activate units that hypotetically could move to any battle hex (counts with ranged attack ability),
but not counts amphibious assault movement restrictions. So it is possible that not every activated unit could join to
battle, you need to undo to activation and choose other set of reaction units.
