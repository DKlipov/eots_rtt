<i>Empire of the Sun</i> is a strategic level look at the entire War in the
Pacific from the attack on Pearl Harbor until the surrender of Japan. This is
the first card driven game (CDG) to move the system closer to a classic hexagon
wargame, while retaining all of the tension and uncertainty people have come to
expect from a CDG. Players are cast in the role of MacArthur, Yamamoto, Nimitz,
and Mountbatten as you direct your forces across the breadth of the globe from
India to Hawaii and from Alaska to Australia.
